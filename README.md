Lasso and CouchDB
=================

Demo CouchApp and basic Lasso code samples to interact with CouchDB.

You'll need to install CouchApp [https://github.com/couchapp/couchapp] in order to "build" the design document and upload it to a CouchDB server.

The .couchapprc file in the root of /couchapp will let you specify a target database server and database to upload the design document to.

I hope you'll consider CouchDB for your next Lasso project!
